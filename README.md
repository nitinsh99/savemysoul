The goal of the project is to build a healthcare emergency related first aid app. The app will be triggered in case of emergencies like fainting and falling which we will simulate using built in sensors of smartphones. In such case it will determine the location of the user and will search for the nearby users and will notify them. App will also notify concerned authorities. Further, functionalities can be extended using dedicated gadgets like heart rate monitor where users will be able to customize their health conditions and define emergencies.
